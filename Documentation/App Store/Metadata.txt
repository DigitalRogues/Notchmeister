Description:

If you have a new MacBook Pro, you also have a new notch. Congratulations!

Have you ever wondered what happens to your mouse while it‘s traveling underneath the notch? Notchmeister answers that question with exciting effects that take your Mac to a whole new dimension:

⁕ Glow - A cursor will light your way.

⁕ Cylon - By your command.

⁕ Plasma Leak - Your mouse can break down the magnetic containment field that keeps the M1‘s power in check!

⁕ Festive - Let your Mac celebrate the holidays the best way it can—in binary.

⁕ Nano Radar - Our patented invention lets you know exactly where your mouse has gone.

Notchmeister is also small and unobtrusive, both visually and with system resources. It's fun, but doesn't get in your way while you work.

And for those of you without a new MacBook Pro, Notchmeister also includes a genuine replacement notch. Be warned that side effects of this feature include making you want this new Mac even more than you already do. Sorry.
